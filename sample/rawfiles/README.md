# Instructions to Extract Split Zip Files

This folder contains split zip files created using **7-Zip**. The files are named sequentially, for example:
```
my_archive.zip.001
my_archive.zip.002
my_archive.zip.003
...
my_archive.zip.014
```

## Requirements
You need **7-Zip** or a compatible extraction tool to combine and extract these split files.

### **Download 7-Zip**
- [7-Zip Official Website](https://www.7-zip.org/)  
- Install 7-Zip based on your operating system.

## Extraction Steps
1. **Ensure all parts are in the same folder.**
   - Make sure all files (`.zip.001` through `.zip.014`) are in the same directory.

2. **Right-click on the first file (`.zip.001`).**
   - Select **7-Zip** -> **Extract Here** or **Extract to 'FolderName/'**.

3. **7-Zip will automatically find and merge the parts.**
   - You do **not** need to manually extract each part.

4. **Wait for the extraction process to complete.**
   - After extraction, you will have access to the full contents in the specified folder.

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter errors:
  1. Verify all parts (`.zip.001` to `.zip.014`) are present and intact.
  2. Ensure the filenames are not modified.
  3. Redownload any corrupted files.
